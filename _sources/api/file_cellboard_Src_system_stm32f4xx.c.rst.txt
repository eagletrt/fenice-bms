Detailed Description
--------------------

MCD Application Team This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from user application:

- :ref:`exhale_function_group__STM32F4xx__System__Private__Functions_1ga93f514700ccf00d08dbdcff7f1224eb2`: This function is called at startup just after reset and before branch to main program. This call is made inside the "startup_stm32f4xx.s" file.

- SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure other parameters.

- :ref:`exhale_function_group__STM32F4xx__System__Private__Functions_1gae0c36a9591fe6e9c45ecb21a794f0f0f`: Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must be called whenever the core clock is changed during program execution.
